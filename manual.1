A node package for running your backend as a background service on Linux

Note: the arguments are passed in the following format:
<command> <argument>=<value>

This is done to minimize the package size.
The argument parsers on npm are ridiculously large.

The .service file is created following @mikemaccana's answer on
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4018154/how-do-i-run-a-node-js-app-as-a-background-service/29042953

Arguments:

char  | full argument    | Description
 h    | help             | Display this
 n    | name             | Name you want to give your service (eg. myApp)*
 e    | entry            | The entry point of the service (eg. index.js)
 f    | distro           | Distribution family either of Ubuntu or RedHat (just pick the side.)
 d    | directory        | [Optional] if the entry point is not in the current directory, specify the path where the entry point is located.

* Name must contain only characters, numbers and underscores

example command:
linuxServiceMaker n=MyApp e=index.js f=Ubuntu
