A node package for running your backend as a background service on Linux

Note: the arguments are passed in the following format:
<command> <argument>=<value>

This is done to minimize the package size.
The argument parsers on npm are ridiculously large.

The .service file is created following @mikemaccana's answer on
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4018154/how-do-i-run-a-node-js-app-as-a-background-service/29042953

 e    | entry            | The entry point of the service (eg. index.js)
